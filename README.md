# hello-world
This is the millionth time I've tried to learn a programming language.

This is a brief summary of my life up until today.
I was born in a small village in the east, the village of Kensington.
I developed a taste for music from a young age, and since then have spent most of my time near it.
That's been going on for 28 years now, with no signs of slowing.
